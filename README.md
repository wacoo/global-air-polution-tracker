<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION  -->

# 📖 The Global Air Pollution Tracker <a name="about-project"></a>


The Global Air Pollution Tracker is a React app that provides comprehensive information on air pollution levels across the globe. It features a curated selection of five countries from each continent, along with data on the gasses that contribute to air pollution. The home page displays these countries, along with their respective API data, allowing users to quickly assess pollution levels. By clicking on a country, users can explore five cities within that country and access detailed pollution data for each city. The app also includes a convenient search feature that enables users to easily find specific countries. With the Global Air Pollution Tracker, users can stay informed about air quality worldwide and make informed decisions to protect their health and the environment.
